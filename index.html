          <h4>What is studyguides.science?</h4>
          <p>Studyguides.science is a collection of notes and studyguides on biology and chemistry.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question-answer">
          <h4>Where did you get these notes?</h4>
          <p>I took these notes while taking biology and chemistry honors myself. Much of the information is based on Google, Holt California Biology Textbook, and Modern Chemistry Textbook. I claim no responsibility for inaccurate info, please don't sue if you get a bad score on the SAT Bio/Chem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question-answer">
          <h4>I'm taking the SAT Bio/Chem subject test. How do I prepare?</h4>
          <p>The Barron's SAT books, plus this website, holds nearly everything you'd need to prepare for the test. Make sure to take at least 3-4 practice tests before the actual test, and thoroughly read the Barron's book. Unless you still feel mightily unprepared, you probably don't need any other books.</p>
